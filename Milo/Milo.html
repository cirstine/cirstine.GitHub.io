<div class=greeting><p>Hello, Visitor! My name is <strong>Milo</strong>. I am 6yrs old and I am from 
<p>the Philippines. I was born on March 4, 2015. I like to play 
<p>a lot, especially, when my mommies and siblings are around. 
<p>I love to eat too! I love any food that's cooked by my mommy.
<p>When I was months old, I was very tiny, but I grew big fast,
<p> probably because I love to drink milk so much, it's my favorite!
<p>I had blue eyes, but now they're brown. My mommies always tell
<p>me that I'm handsome no matter what color my eyes are. I love
<p>my family so much!
