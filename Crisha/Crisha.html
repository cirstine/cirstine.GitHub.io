<div class=greeting><p>Hello, Visitor! My name is <strong>Crisha</strong>. I am 5yrs old and I am from 
<p>the Philippines. I was born on October 14, 2015. I am a Toy Poodle. 
<p>My mommies took me home for the first time in December 2015. I feel
<p>so loved everyday. I'm kinda spoiled too. It actually annoys me when
<p>my mommies' attention is on something else. I love playing with them,
<p> and being hugged by them. They always feed me delicious homecooked 
<p>food with lots of veggies! They're my favorite! I always sleep too,
<p>especially when I am on my mommy's lap. It makes me feel relaxed. 
<p>I am so lucky because I have a family that loves me so much!
